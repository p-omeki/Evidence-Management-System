        relevant case details, victim information, and additional information as needed.</p>

    <h2>3. Can I upload various types of evidence?</h2>

        insights and information from the collected evidence, aiding in the investigative process.</p>

    <h2>5. What happens to disposed cases?</h2>

        within the recycle bin timeframe.</p>

    <h2>6. How is user access controlled in the system?</h2>

        app for added flexibility and convenience in the future.</p>

    <h2>9. How is sensitive information secured in the system?</h2>
    <p>The system employs data encryption to ensure the security of sensitive information. This helps protect against
        unauthorized access and maintains the confidentiality of case and evidence details.</p>

    <h2>10. Can I receive notifications for important events?</h2>
